For purposes of these API Terms, the following terms have the following meanings:

"API Key" means a unique string identifying You and/or each Application as a user of the Riot Games API, assigned by Riot to You and/or each Application in Riot's sole discretion, to enable You and/or such Application to access and/or use the Riot Games API. The Riot Games API may include (a) separate "keys" for (i) development and/or personal (i.e., lower usage rate) purposes (a "Development Key") and (ii) production purposes (a "Production Key"), and/or (b) other unique identifier(s) assigned by Riot to You and/or each Application.

"Application" means a software application and/or website owned, controlled or made available by You that incorporates, accesses or uses any Materials.

"Game Information" means metadata arising from the Game regarding user profiles, user gameplay history, statistics, team information, "summoner" preferences and other information related to the Game and competitive Game events as may be provided by Riot through the Riot Games API in its sole discretion from time to time.

"Materials" means any and all of the following: the Riot Games API, the API Keys, the Game Information, the Specifications (including any copies, portions, extracts and derivatives thereof) and any related materials (excluding the Riot Marks) made available by or on behalf of Riot to You pursuant to these API Terms or otherwise in connection with the Riot Games API.

"Riot Games API" means any application programming interface(s) and other related information (which may consist of software, data, functions, features, code, instructions and/or other technology) currently accessible through the Riot Developer Site, and as may be identified in the Specifications and/or designated by Riot from time to time in Riot's sole discretion.

"Works" means all discoveries, ideas, inventions, concepts, developments, know-how, trade secrets, works of authorship, materials, specifications, software (source and object code), technology and other creations.

API KEYS

To access and use the Riot Games API, You may create only one (1) developer account and You must complete the Riot Games API developer registration process by providing Your Game username and password on the Riot Developer Site and by providing any other information as may be requested by Riot. In Riot's sole discretion, You may then be issued one or more unique Developer Keys for accessing and using the Riot Games API and managing Your account. Thereafter, You may complete the Riot Games API application registration process by submitting Your Application for registration by Riot on the Riot Developer Site. By submitting an Application to Riot, You represent and warrant that such Application complies with these API Terms and the Specifications. You shall not hide, misrepresent or obscure any features, content, services or functionality in such Application. Riot will have the right (but not the obligation), in its sole discretion, to register such Application, and Riot reserves the right to delay the provision or activation of any Production Key and/or any other Materials until the completion of any such registration. You will provide any materials, data and other information as may be requested by Riot to confirm that such Application complies with these API Terms and the Specifications. If Your Application is registered by Riot, You will then be issued one or more unique Production Keys for such Application to access and use the Riot Games API.

API Keys may, at any time, be subject to activation, suspension and/or deactivation by Riot to ensure usage consistent with these API Terms and all applicable requirements, and for any other reason in Riot's sole discretion. You may only access the Riot Games API with the API Key(s) provided to You by Riot. You may not sell, transfer, sublicense or otherwise disclose Your API Key(s) to any other party. Maintaining account security is very important. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your API Key(s). You agree to notify Riot immediately if You believe that Your API Key(s) have been compromised.

You are fully responsible and liable for all activities that occur using Your API Key(s) and/or Your Application(s) (including acts or omissions that would constitute a breach of these API Terms if made by You), regardless of whether such activities are undertaken by You or a third party. As between You and Riot, You are solely responsible for all aspects of each Application, and Riot will not be required to provide any technical or other support services to You or any user of any Application in connection with any Materials, including with respect to any integration of the Riot Games API with an Application. Riot is not responsible for monitoring or policing any dispute that may arise between or among You, any user, and/or any other third party. Your use of the Materials is at Your own risk, and You are solely responsible for any damage that results from any use of the Materials, including any damage to You or any user's computer systems or networks, or any loss of data.
